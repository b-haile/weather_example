# Web Scraping Site Data into Excel

I received a query from a friend the other day: how would you take numerical data from a webpage and pull it into an Excel worksheet? This friend works in an office that does not normally deal with Python or other languages designed for controlling data. It had to be done with Excel for ease of use. My experience in web scraping is almost entirely in Python, so this query presented a new challenge for me. After dabbling with this process and finding some success, here are the steps I took:

## 1. Open the Inspector

Once your desired webpage is open(shown below), right-click in some blank space. The drop-down menu will include a command called “Inspect”. Click this command, and a window will open showing the code behind the webpage.
